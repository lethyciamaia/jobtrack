# JobTrack

**JobTrack API** is a simple project built to help track internship and job applications. It's an API developed using Golang as part of a personal learning project.

The API allows you to create, list, update, and delete applications, helping you keep track of the progress of your professional opportunities.

## Purpose

This project is being developed to gain hands-on experience with Golang and build a practical application that can be used for tracking job or internship applications. 

Currently, itâ€™s a work-in-progress, and more features will be added as I continue learning Go.

## Features

- **Basic CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update and Delete aplications.
- **Routing**: Integration of gorilla/mux router to manage HTTP request routes.
- **Persistence**: Persistence using GORM (a Go ORM library) and PostgreSQL to store data.
