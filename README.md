# JobTrack

**JobTrack API** is a simple project built to help track internship and job applications. It's an API developed using Golang as part of a personal learning project.

The API allows you to create, list, update, and delete applications, helping you keep track of the progress of your professional opportunities.

## Purpose

This project is being developed to gain hands-on experience with Golang and build a practical application that can be used for tracking job or internship applications. 

Currently, itâ€™s a work-in-progress, and more features will be added as I continue learning Go.

## Features

- **Create**: Add a new application.
- **List**: View all applications.
- **Update**: Update the status of an application.
- **Delete**: Remove an application.
